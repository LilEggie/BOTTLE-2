# BOTTLE-2

### V2 (In Development)
Version 2 aims to be a more polished and feature-rich iteration of BOTTLE-2. It will expand the game library by introducing additional word-based challenges, including *Duordle*, *Crosswordle*, and more. This version will also include a revamped UI/UX for a smoother, more visually appealing experience. Additionally, plans are in place to introduce a multiplayer mode, allowing players to compete against each other in real-time to see who can solve puzzles faster or in fewer guesses. Other improvements will focus on performance optimization, bug fixes, and gameplay enhancements.
