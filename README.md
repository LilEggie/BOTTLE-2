# BOTTLE-2

### V1
Version 1 serves as a proof of concept for BOTTLE-2, showcasing the initial implementation of word-based puzzle games. It includes functional versions of *The New York Times Wordle* and *Feudle*, allowing users to engage with these classic challenges. However, this version still has a few minor bugs that need to be addressed, along with UI refinements to enhance the overall look and feel. Future updates will focus on improving stability, fixing known issues, and refining the user experience.
