## Puzzle Games

### The New York Times Wordle  
*The New York Times Wordle* is a word puzzle game where players have six attempts to guess a hidden five-letter word. With each guess, letters are color-coded to indicate their correctness: green for correct letters in the right position, yellow for correct letters in the wrong position, and gray for letters not in the word. This version of Wordle will be an exact replica of the official New York Times game, offering the same mechanics and challenge.  

### Feudle  
**Feudle** is a word-guessing game where players must determine the missing word in a given sentence. The goal is to use contextual clues to predict the most likely word that fits within the provided phrase. Currently, the sentences are sourced from [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) and [YourDictionary](https://sentence.yourdictionary.com/), ensuring a diverse and educational range of sentence structures and vocabulary.

### Duordle  
*Duordle* is a more complex variation of Wordle, where players attempt to solve two Wordle puzzles at the same time. Each guess applies to both puzzles simultaneously, requiring strategic thinking to balance progress on both grids. With a limited number of attempts, players must carefully choose their words to maximize information and solve both words before running out of guesses.  

### Mathle  
*Mathle* is a number-based puzzle game that challenges players to uncover a hidden equation. Instead of letters, players must input numerical expressions that satisfy the given constraints. Correct numbers and operators will be highlighted based on their accuracy and placement, similar to Wordle’s feedback system. This game tests both logical reasoning and arithmetic skills, making it a fun yet challenging alternative for players who enjoy math-based puzzles.  

## Versions

### V1
Version 1 serves as a proof of concept for BOTTLE-2, showcasing the initial implementation of word-based puzzle games. It includes functional versions of *The New York Times Wordle* and *Feudle*, allowing users to engage with these classic challenges. However, this version still has a few minor bugs that need to be addressed, along with UI refinements to enhance the overall look and feel. Future updates will focus on improving stability, fixing known issues, and refining the user experience.  

### V2 (In Development)
Version 2 aims to be a more polished and feature-rich iteration of BOTTLE-2. It will expand the game library by introducing additional word-based challenges, including *Duordle*, *Crosswordle*, and more. This version will also include a revamped UI/UX for a smoother, more visually appealing experience. Additionally, plans are in place to introduce a multiplayer mode, allowing players to compete against each other in real-time to see who can solve puzzles faster or in fewer guesses. Other improvements will focus on performance optimization, bug fixes, and gameplay enhancements.
